# Stock-Volatility
Innovative project leveraging ARCH models to predict stock volatility using historical data from Yahoo Finance. ARCH models are adept at capturing volatility clustering in financial analytics.

# Project Objectives:

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust predictive model that can accurately estimate stock volatility for a specified period. By utilizing ARCH models, which are designed to handle time-varying volatility, we aim to provide investors and traders with valuable insights into potential market risks.

# Key Components and Methodology:

Data Collection: Gather historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, including price and volume information over the specified period.

Data Preprocessing: Cleanse and preprocess the data to handle missing values and outliers, ensuring the dataset is suitable for analysis.

Data Visualization: Conduct visualization to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Training and Validation: Split the data into training and validation sets to train the selected ARCH model. Utilize techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model's generalizability and prevent overfitting.

Visualization and Prediction: Visualize the predicted volatility alongside actual volatility to provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the model's accuracy. Additionally, interpret the results to identify potential patterns or trends in stock volatility
